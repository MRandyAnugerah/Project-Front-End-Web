				<h3>Remember Me</h3>
				<h2>Coco</h2>
				<p>Remember me.
					Though I have to say goodbye.
					Remember me.
					Don't let it make you cry.
					For ever if I'm far away.
					"I hold you in my heart."
					I sing a secret song to you.
					Each night we are apart.
					"Remember me.
					Though I have to travel far.""
					Remember me.
					Each time you hear a sad guitar.
					Know that I'm with you.	
					The only way that I can be.
					Until you're in my arms again.
					Remember me.</p>

				<h3>U Are My Home</h3>
				<p>Oh you shine bright.
					Brighter than all the stars.
					Brighter than fireworks.
					So "I give you all my love".
					And you re perfection even in your mistakes.
					Give affection.
					Even when your heart aches.
					When I'm away.
					You re who I'm thinking of.
					Because....
					You are my home home home.Wherever I may roam.
					You are the place where
					I can rest my weary bones.<br>
					"You are my home home home"</p>

				<h3>How Far I'll Go</h3>
				<p>I've been standing at the edge of the water
					'Long as I can remember. never really knowing why.
					I wish I could be the perfect daughter.
					But I come back to the water. no matter how hard I try.
					Every turn I take, every trail I track.
					Every path I make, every road leads back.
					To the place I know, where I can not go
					Though I long to be.
					See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me.
					And no one knows, how far it goes.
					If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me.
					One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go.</p>

				<h3>Try Everything</h3>
				<p>
					Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
					I messed up tonight.
					I lost another fight.
					Lost to myself, but I'll just start again.
					I keep falling down.
					I keep on hitting the ground.
					But I always get up now to see what's next.
					<br>
					Birds don't just fly.
					They fall down and get up.
					Nobody learns without getting it wrong.
					I won't give up.
					No, I won't give in till I reach the end.
					<br>
					"And then I'll start again
					No, I won't leave"
					I want to try everything
					I want to try even though I could fail
